## Hi there 👋

<!--

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)

## Stretch Goals (enchancements)

- add html linter
because it's hard to understand if everything is good or not

https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-html

we can use https://www.freeformatter.com/html-validator.html and see errors. not sure if they actually valid, but will be cool to pay attention to some of them

- add links checker
